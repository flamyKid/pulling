Pulling
=============
Pulling is an open source python repository for working with files of different extensions. Documentation in English can be found here - https://github.com/ItYaS/pulling/wiki.
The repository now supports .txt .rtf .pdf .docx .csv .avro .json formats.

Future
======================
Such a repository can be extended for life. That's what I will do. But the next version (where there will be parsing from other formats) will not be released soon. So, keep this repository and be patient.

In the future, I want to parse .orc .rcf .parquet .feather (and one day .doc .odt), add conversion to other extensions for all formats, add new functions, and new formats.

Version 1.4
======================
- The code readability was also fixed and all unnecessary loops were removed.
- Fixed bugs and architecture
- Removed unnecessary code
- Improved readability and usability
