# Pulling
Pulling is an open source python repository for working with files of different extensions. Documentation in English can be found [here](https://github.com/ItYaS/pulling/wiki).
The repository now supports .txt .rtf .pdf .docx .csv .avro .json formats.

## Future
Such a repository can be extended for life. That's what I will do. But the next version (where there will be parsing from other formats) will not be released soon, because in 2020 and 2021, I am preparing for exams and admission to the Institute. So, keep this repository and be patient.

In the future, I want to parse .orc .rcf .parquet .feather (and one day .doc .odt), add conversion to other extensions for all formats, add new functions, and new formats.
